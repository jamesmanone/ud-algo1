# Problem 2: Search in Rotated Array

To solve this problem I broke it into 2 pieces - `find_min` and `binary_search`. `find_min` finds the minimum index of a rotated array. It's a modified binary search and has the same complexity. for `binary_search` and `find_min` I went with an iterative approach to avoid extra space from slicing or extraneous arguments. Once `find_min` has found the min index `rotated_search` uses `arr[-1]` as the first comparison in a binary search, passing either the larger (earlier) or smaller(later) slice of the array to `binary_search`. `find_min` and `binary_search` are each O(log(n)). O(log(n) + log(n)) = O(log(n)). This implementation uses O(n) space because the slice operator makes a copy. If I could make a view into the input array this space complexity could be eliminated.
